## About Me 
![alt text](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/55901495?s=460&v=4)

Hello there! My name is Stacey and I am currently pursuing an education in software development at Delta V Code School. Prior to joining Delta V, I earned my BS in psychology from Coe College in 2015, after which I worked as a full time Sign Language Interpreter and ran a small photography business. As I embark on my software development journey, this page will feature my daily reading assingments from DeltaV's 201 course as a way of digesting the intricate world of programming. Hop on over to 
[My GitHub Page](https://github.com/selmaT273) to checkout what I've been working on!
